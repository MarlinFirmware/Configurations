          Thanks for your contribution! Unfortunately we can't accept PRs directed at the `bugfix-2.0.x` branch. We make patches to `import-2.0.x` and then generate `bugfix-2.0.x` and `release-x.x.x` from that.

          Please redo this PR starting with the current `import-2.0.x` branch and be careful to target `import-2.0.x` when resubmitting the PR.

          It may help to set your fork's default branch to `import-2.0.x`.

          See [this page](http://marlinfw.org/docs/development/getting_started_pull_requests.html) for full instructions.
