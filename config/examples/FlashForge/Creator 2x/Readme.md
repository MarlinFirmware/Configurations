IMPORTANT NOTE ON FLASHING THE FIRMWARE:

The firmware for the Atmel chip used for USB on the Mighty Board is the same as the Arduino Mega's
, but it doesn't do an automatic reset. So you will need to push the reset button just before the upload. 
If you want the printer to reset on DTR you will need to flash it with the firmware for the Arduino Mega.
