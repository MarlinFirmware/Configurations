## Two Trees Sapphire Configurations

This folder contains default configurations for the Two Trees Sapphire.

One initial configuration is provided:

- `Sapphire Plus V2` : The large 300x300x350 CoreXY printer with dual Z axis limit switches.

Note that the configuration uses the Marlin touch UI rather than the MKS one.
