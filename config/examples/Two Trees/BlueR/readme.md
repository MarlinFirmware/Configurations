## Two Trees BlueR Configurations

This folder contains default configurations for the Two Trees BlueR.

Three different configuration folders are provided, suitable for the different BlueR release versions:

- BlueR V1 : First version of BlueR with a metal extruder.
- BlueR V2 (formerly "BlueR" out of the box) : BMG extruder with Blue parts and integrated endstop for X and Z.
- BlueR V3 (formerly "BlueR V2" out of the box) : BMG extruder and more Black parts as your predecessor.

Note: Some users may find the E motor goes in reverse with BlueR V2, so two configurations are provided. If your motor rotates in the wrong direction, use the "inverted" version (or make the equivalent change).
