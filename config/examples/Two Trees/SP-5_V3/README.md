## Two Trees SP-5 V3 Configurations

This folder contains default configurations for the SP-5 V3.


Changes from default Two Trees SP-5 V3 supplied configuration:

- Using TFT_COLOR_UI

Orrginal Marlin code from Two Trees https://wetransfer.com/downloads/80c678c69652aae3dc35635262ebd0a320240418061003/27392ff160a713aeea143b9c7ffad79d20240418061018/6ffdaa?trk=TRN_TDL_01&utm_campaign=TRN_TDL_01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sendgrid
Uses a modifed version of TFT_LVGL_UI with its own graphics and some additional screens.

Since these are not present in stock Marllin I have chossen to use TFT_COLOR_UI instead.
