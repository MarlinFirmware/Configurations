Configuration files for the K8400, ported upstream from the official Velleman firmware.
Like its predecessor, (K8200), the K8400 is a 3Drag clone. There are some minor differences, documented in pins_K8400.h.

Single and dual head configurations provided. Copy the correct Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h to the /src/config directory.

> [!NOTE]
