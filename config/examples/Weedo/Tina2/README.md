## Adding wifi support using ESP3D

You can add wifi support using [ESP3D](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D).
Basically connect your own NodeMCU to second serial port of the MCU.
See ESP3D wiki for connection diagram.

In Marlin configuration.h set:
`#define SERIAL_PORT_2 3`

## Manufacturer wifi support

Examples provided here have not been tested with wifi board from manufacturer.
Setting `#define SERIAL_PORT_2 3` in Marlin configuration.h might be enough to work with manufacturer wifi board.

Feedback are welcome.
