# Anycubic Vyper Support

This configuration is based on the published firmware v2.4.5 from Anycubic. It is **not** the authoritative source, but has been carefully re-built by looking at their firmware.

## LCD Languages

The stock Vyper LCD supports English and Chinese.  This firmware is located in the **English_Chinese** folder.  This folder was downloaded from the Anycubic site.

An English and German version is available in the **English_German** folder.  To switch, copy the entire **DWIN_SET** folder to the top level of an SD card, insert the SD card into the LCD and power cycle the LCD.
