Making a custom Boot screen 

To make a custom boot screen there are 5 requirements.
1 the file format must be .JPG
2 Progressive must be tuned off in the export settings.(under advanced in GIMP)
3 The Subsampling format must be chroma quartered ( 4:2:0 )(also under advanced in GIMP)
4 The resolution must be 480x272 
		Note
		the left side of the image will be the top. You can have the image upright as 272x480
		while you make it but before you export it you must rotate it. Rotating after export in
		windows seems to be a modifier that at least the DACAI screen does not understand.
		and i doubt that the DWIN screen will ether
5 The file must be named “0”  and placed in private/image for the DACAI Screen or “0_start” and placed in DWIN_SET for the DWIN screen
After this you just have to follow the normal screen flashing instructions.
