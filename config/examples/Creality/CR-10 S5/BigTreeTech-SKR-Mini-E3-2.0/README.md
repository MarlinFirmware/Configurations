# Creality CR-10 S5 Notes

This printer comes with a LCD that is set to REPRAP_DISCOUNT_FULL_GRAPHIC_SMART_CONTROLLER LCD mode. This mode requires 2 * 10 pin connectors. The SKR Mini E3 2.0 only has 1 of these connectors.

On the stock LCD there should be 3 EXP plugs. If you remove the cable from EXP2, and move the cable from EXP1 to EXP3 this LCD then becomes CR10_STOCKDISPLAYatable with CR10_STOCKDISPLAY

NB These Configuration files are set up for a CR10_STOCKDISPLAY
