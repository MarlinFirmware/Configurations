# Ender-3 S1 display update guide

Starting with Ender-3 V2, the Ender-3 series **knob**-based (_not_ touch screens) color LCD screens share the same update procedure, with the only difference being the files that need to be copied to a microSD card, based on the type of display unit mainboard.

Please refer to the `README` document for the complete procedure and display variant compatibility list, available here:

`../config/examples/Creality/Ender-3 V2/LCD Files`
