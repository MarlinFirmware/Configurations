# Ender-3 S1 display update guide

Starting with the Ender-3 V2, Creality introduced a series of color LCDs that use a **click-wheel** (but _not_ a touch screen). These displays can connect to any board with an EXP adapter and they all share the same basic update procedure. Different mainboards will require different files to be copied to the microSD card, but after that you just insert it into the display for flashing.

See the `Creality/Ender-3 V2/README.md` file for the complete update procedure and information on display compatibility.
