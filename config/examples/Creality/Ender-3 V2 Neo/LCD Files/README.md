# Ender-3 V2 Neo display update guide

Starting with Ender-3 V2, the Ender-3 series **knob**-based (_not_ touch screens) color LCD screens share the same update procedure, with the only difference being the files that need to be copied to a microSD card, based on the type of display unit mainboard.

See the `Creality/Ender-3 V2/README.md` file for the complete update procedure and display variant compatibility list.
